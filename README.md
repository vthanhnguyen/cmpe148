CMPE 148 Project: Arduino Data Communication Between Server and Client

How to prepare node_modules and package dependencies:
    - "npm init", creates package.json

We need to check if the dependency is added, if pulled from github, we just need to type the command.
Now, inside of package.json, we're using serial port version 9.0.1
So add that in there and install the node_modules needed by typing:
    - "npm install ." installs node module dependencies

To start the server:
    node app.js
