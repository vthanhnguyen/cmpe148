CMPE 148 Project: Arduino Data Communication Between Server and Client
This project focuses on computer networks by creating the map of a server with a slave(arduino) and a client. The arduino communicates with the server and client in order to give data and control devices.

How to run: 


After pulling cloning from github, we still need the dependencies.

Typing in: "npm install ."

This command will download a folder called node_modules so we can use the API for 'socket.io' and 'serial Port'

To start the server:
    node app.js
