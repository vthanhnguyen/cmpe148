CMPE 148 Project: Arduino Data Communication Between Server and Client

This project focuses on computer networks by creating the map of a server with a slave(arduino) and a client. The arduino communicates with the server and client in order to give data and control devices.

There will be 3 experiments in this project. 

First, will be using a potentialometer and displaying its values to the webpage.
Second, will be sending voltage to a LED.
Third, will be using capacitive soil moisture sensor.

How to run: 
After pulling cloning from github, we still need the dependencies.
Typing in: "npm install ."

This command will download a folder called node_modules so we can use the API for 'socket.io' and 'serial Port'

To start the server:

"node app.js"
