CMPE 148 Project: Arduino Data Communication Between Server and Client

How to prepare node_modules and package dependencies:
    npm init
    npm install serialport

Now, inside of package.json, we're using serial port version 9.0.1
So add that in there and install the node_modules needed by typing:
    npm install

To start the server:
    node app.js
